# Hi there! üëã I'm Maria Diaz

Originally from Madrid, Spain, now based in Miami, I‚Äôve taken an exciting journey from forensic sciences and cybersecurity into the world of artificial intelligence. Along the way, I discovered my passion for building impactful tech solutions that connect innovation with real-world needs.

I love tackling challenges, exploring how AI can solve emerging societal demands, and ensuring technology is applied ethically and meaningfully. My main interests lie in AI research, the creative side of machine learning, and building deep learning models that bring groundbreaking ideas to life.

üåç Beyond tech, I‚Äôm always looking for my next adventure‚Äîwhether it's traveling, discovering new places, or meeting inspiring people who expand my personal and professional horizons.
